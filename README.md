This repository hosts a full-stack web interface designed to predict health outcomes for extremely pre-term born babies (22-25 weeks gestational age). The project is the fourth in a series of six estimators, providing an intuitive user experience through a browser-based interface adaptable to various technologies. This solution aims to support healthcare professionals with fast, reliable predictions through real-time, data-driven insights.

The backend is developed using Node.js, while the frontend offers a responsive and accessible design. The system connects to a PostgreSQL database for managing medical data, and the application is deployed via Heroku for seamless cloud access. This solution aims to support healthcare professionals with fast, reliable predictions through real-time, data-driven insights.

***The output of this tool is not intended to be the only basis for making clinical care recommendations for any infant.  It predicts outcomes for infants with similar characteristics and is unable to predict the outcome of any one child. There are many other factors not addressed in this tool that are likely to affect survival, ECMO use, and/or LOS. The manuscript describing statistical analyses/methods is under preparation***
